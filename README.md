##How To BlenderConnect
BlenderConnect is enabled/disabled through two buttons in the Plugin menu point in Mastodon.
To connect to Blender, Blender and the accompanying script must be started and working (check system console for errors).
The connection is established through Py4J on localhost and the standard port.

For the BlenderConnect Plugin to work correctly, the py4j.jar must be added to the Fiji/jars folder along with this projects jar-File.
